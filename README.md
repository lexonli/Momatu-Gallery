# Momatu-Gallery
A photo gallery made for the junior mobile dev coding challenge

Here is a list of some of the features:

1. The best photo size is calculated based on resolution and then requested from the Picsum API, this allows for better performance in laying out cells
2. Dynamic pagination means a continuous scroll, new data is fetched when user scrolls to near the end of the collection view
3. Cache is used to allow for UIImages to be stored in memory
4. The gallery is in a grid layout, allowing for different number of columns to be set

Please leave some feedback! :)
